## Native Text Rule (default)

The cover is a finished design, not a background plate. By default, ask the image model to
render the Chinese title natively as part of the composition, with attractive typography,
correct glyphs, and the title integrated into the visual register. Do not generate an empty
title zone for later local overlay unless the user explicitly asks for editable text.

For Xiaohongshu, public-account covers, video thumbnails, and other thumb-stopping assets,
native title design is part of the product. If the text comes out wrong, first repair with a
text-fix edit or regenerate with a shorter/clearer title. Treat local overlay as an explicit
exception, not the default.

## Final Generation Prompt

```text
Generate one social cover image in the Cover Pop style.

Platform & aspect ratio:
{小红书 3:4 vertical / 公众号 2.35:1 / 视频 16:9}

Topic:
{one sentence}

Target reader:
{who is scrolling past, and in what moment}

Core promise:
{what they get if they tap}

Archetype:
{大字 / 反差 / 清单·数字 / 教程 / 情绪 / 实拍 / 盘点}

Aesthetic register — routed by subject (style-routing.md), applied to the whole cover:
{e.g. 瑞士网格 / 水墨·文人画 (rice paper + 书法 title + 印章) / 工作室静物 / Hopper 斜射光+留白 / 大胆极简编辑 / 圆润流行}
- ground, palette, light, and type voice all follow this register
- the title-legibility harness below runs inside it

Title — render this exact text, correct Chinese characters, no other text:
- main line: "{≤ 15 字}"
- sub line (optional): "{≤ 10 字}"

Title treatment:
- main line is the hero, heavy clean sans-serif (思源黑体 / 黑体 weight)
- readable at 200px-wide thumbnail, high contrast against its backdrop
- sits on a solid block / clean photo area / subtle highlight bar, not on busy texture
- at most one accent color or one highlight bar on the key word

Focal subject:
{one subject: the words themselves / a real object / a split before-after / a tidy grid / a quiet scene}

Layout:
- one focal subject, one promise, generous margins
- title placed in a calm zone with breathing room
- {archetype-specific layout from cover-archetypes.md}

Palette:
- follow the routed register's palette logic (ink+paper+seal-red for 水墨; two saturated flats for bold editorial; one base+one accent+one ink for grid/editorial)
- keep it restrained: avoid rainbow gradients regardless of register

Style:
- clean, premium, real — like a followable account in this niche
- real texture: clean photo / flat color block / paper grain / soft studio light
- no 微商 gold-red glow, scattered stickers, sparkle bursts, or fake urgency badges
- no 土味 WordArt, bevel, neon-on-neon, or double drop shadow
- no PPT title-slide look, no stock-photo-plus-color-bar
- no AI plastic: no melted text, no extra fingers, no waxy skin, no gibberish characters

Quality target:
publish-grade cover, title readable in one second, one real promise, would make the target reader stop scrolling.
```

## Text-Fix Edit Prompt

Image models often mangle Chinese characters. When the composition is good but the text is wrong:

```text
Use $cover-pop to edit this cover.

Keep:
- the composition, focal subject, palette, and layout

Fix:
- re-render the title as EXACTLY: "{correct text}"
- correct, clean Chinese characters, no melted/doubled/gibberish glyphs
- main line heavy and readable at thumbnail size
- remove any extra hallucinated text, watermark, or logo
```

If the model cannot render clean Chinese after a repair pass, prefer shortening the title,
changing the title treatment, or regenerating with stronger typography constraints. Do not switch
to a blank-title external overlay route unless the user explicitly chooses that production path.
